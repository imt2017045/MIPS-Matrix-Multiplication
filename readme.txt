AB = C

where
	A, B, C : matrices

The input A and B is given in "inputfile.txt". Then fileinput.cpp is run, which generates another file "bitdata.txt" which contains the 
values in 32 bit binary form. 

Then, the testbench is executed. Then run executable "./a.out".

The output contains 10 matrices. These are the matrices after every element of the result is updated. So, the last matrix is the answer.
